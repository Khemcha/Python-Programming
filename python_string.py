# we can create a string by surrounding some text with quotation marks:
# We can use either single quotes (string1) or double quotes (string2) to create a string as long as you use the same type at the beginning
# and end of the string.

# Assigning a string to a variable
string1 = 'This is string'
string2 = "3600"

# Concatenating strings: You can concatenate (combine) strings using the + operator:

greeting = "Hi, "
name = "Trinay"
full_message = greeting + name
print(full_message)
